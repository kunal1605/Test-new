cd--> chande directory
cd .. --> going one step back
ls--> list all the files
ls -a --> to see all files including hidden files(accessible only hrough terminal)
	
git status--> to check status of newly added or modified files
git add (you file name)--> adds new or changed files in your working directory to git staging area

git commit -m ("your message")---->this is called after git add, this is in your local pc only not on remote

git push origin main---> to upload local repo content to remote reop(origin is the default reponame on GitHub , and we are pushing in main branch



Creating repo from our Local machine(Laptop)
-------------------------------------------------
git init---> initialize git on a folder
git status--> check the status 
git add--> add that file to staging area
git commit -m "message" --> commit your changes(int  you local)
now if you want to push your changes to remote server, create a repo form your profile
